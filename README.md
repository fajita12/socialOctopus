### Build Instructions

Building the project is relatively simple; you must have ionic installed on the computer you are using and then check out the tagged 'Iteration2' code.  Once this has been done, cd into the ionic directory and run 'ionic lab' to start a local server to test the code in a local browser.  'ionic lab' allows you to see the application in a prepackaged iOS, Android, or Windows emulator.  If you wish to view the application natively in the browser, run 'ionic serve'.  

```sh
$ mkdir socialOctopus
$ git clone 
$ cd socialOctopus/ionic
$ ionic lab
```

Once open, you can register for an account, and login and play around with the features

Note: You must manually add an account from the edit user page (Swipe Right)

If you would prefer to skip this step and use a test account we have created, you can login with the following credentials: 

    Username: test
    Password: test

This account already has all supported accounts linked and has been the account used to test all functionality.
