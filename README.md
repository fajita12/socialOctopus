Now this branch contains all hooked up working code. HomePage is not updated and it's still the work done last time we meet at March 18 Sunday. So if people working on the code the feed part, please copy and paste your new work to this exisiting code frame works. Please refer https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uF-PoTZts46N7FzjEeEZbSR8ifVCpeBRDF_LZwZw4Oc/edit?usp=sharing this document for detailed updates and what has been done to this code. You might run into the issue of running the code, but the resolving method has been specified in the documents. If you use your UW-Madison Email account to log in your google drive you will be able to see this document withohut requesting access. Let me know if you have more questions. 

Thanks
